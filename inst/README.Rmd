This repository contains the `R` package which is [hosted on Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mixOmics.html) and our stable and development `GitHub` versions.

## Installation

(**macOS users only:** Ensure you have installed [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) first.)

### From Bioconductor

The best way to install `mixOmics` is using `Bioconductor`. You can see the landing page for the release version of `mixOmics` on Bioconductor [here](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mixOmics.html). 

Make sure you have the latest R version and the latest `BiocManager` package installed following [these instructions](https://www.bioconductor.org/install/).

```{r}
## install BiocManager if not installed
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

## install mixOmics
BiocManager::install('mixOmics')

## load mixOmics
library(mixOmics) 
```

### From Github

Bioconductor versions are updated twice a year, between these updates you can downlod the latest stable version of `mixOmics` from `Github` using:

```{r}
BiocManager::install('mixOmicsTeam/mixOmics')
```

You can also install the [development version](https://github.com/mixOmicsTeam/mixOmics/tree/development) for new features yet to be widely tested:

```{r}
BiocManager::install("mixOmicsTeam/mixOmics@development")
```


### From `Docker` container

You can install our latest stable Github version of `mixOmics` via our Docker container. You can do this by downloading and using the Docker desktop application or via the command line as described below. 

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  
**Note: this requires root privileges**


1) Install Docker following instructions at https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

**if your OS is not compatible with the latest version** download an older version of Docker from the following link:

* MacOS: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/release-notes/
* Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/release-notes/

Then open your system's command line interface (e.g. Terminal for MacOS and Command Promot for Windows) for the following steps.

**MacOS users only:** you will need to launch Docker Desktop to activate your root privileges before running any docker commands from the command line.
    
2) Pull mixOmics container

```bash
docker pull mixomicsteam/mixomics
```

3) Ensure it is installed

The following command lists the running images:
```bash
docker images
```

This lists the installed images. The output should be something similar to the following:
```
$ docker images 
  > REPOSITORY                       TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
  > mixomicsteam/mixomics            latest    e755393ac247   2 weeks ago     4.38GB
```
4) Activate the container

Running the following command activates the container. You must change `your_password` to a custom password of your own. You can also customise ports (8787:8787) if desired/necessary. see https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/ for details.

```bash
docker run -e PASSWORD=your_password --rm -p 8787:8787 mixomicsteam/mixomics
```

5) Run

In your web browser, go to `http://localhost:8787/` (change port if necessary) and login with the following credentials:

*username*: rstudio  
*password*: (your_password set in step 4)

6) Inspect/stop

The following command lists the running containers:

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

The output should be something similar to the following:
```bash
$ sudo docker ps
  > CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                   COMMAND   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES
  > f14b0bc28326   mixomicsteam/mixomics   "/init"   7 minutes ago   Up 7 minutes   0.0.0.0:8787->8787/tcp   compassionate_mestorf
```
The listed image ID can then be used to stop the container (here `f14b0bc28326`)
```bash
docker stop f14b0bc28326
```

<summary>
Set up development environment
</summary>

* Install the latest version of R
* Install RStudio
* Clone this repo, checkout master branch, pull origin and then run:

```r
install.packages("renv", Ncpus=4)
install.packages("devtools", Ncpus=4)

# restore the renv environment
renv::restore()

# or to initialise renv
# renv::init(bioconductor = TRUE)

# update the renv environment if needed
# renv::snapshot()

# test installation
devtools::install()
devtools::test()

# complete package check (takes a while)
devtools::check()
```

### Discussion forum

We wish to make our discussions transparent so please direct your analysis questions to our discussion forum https://mixomics-users.discourse.group. This forum is aimed to host discussions on choices of multivariate analyses, as well as comments and suggestions to improve the package. We hope to create an active community of users, data analysts, developers and R programmers alike! Thank you!


## About the `mixOmics` team

`mixOmics` is collaborative project between Australia (Melbourne), France (Toulouse), and Canada (Vancouver). The core team includes Kim-Anh Lê Cao - https://lecao-lab.science.unimelb.edu.au (University of Melbourne), Florian Rohart - http://florian.rohart.free.fr (Toulouse) and Sébastien Déjean - https://perso.math.univ-toulouse.fr/dejean/. We also have key contributors, past (Benoît Gautier, François Bartolo) and present (Al Abadi, University of Melbourne) and several collaborators including Amrit Singh (University of British Columbia), Olivier Chapleur (IRSTEA, Paris), Antoine Bodein (Universite de Laval) - **it could be you too, if you wish to be involved!**.

The project started at the _Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse_ in France, and has been fully implemented in Australia, at the _University of Queensland_, Brisbane (2009 – 2016) and at the _University of Melbourne_, Australia (from 2017). We focus on the development of computational and statistical methods for biological data integration and their implementation in `mixOmics`.

## Why this toolkit?

`mixOmics` offers a wide range of novel multivariate methods for the exploration and integration of biological datasets with a particular focus on variable selection. Single ‘omics analysis does not provide enough information to give a deep understanding of a biological system, but we can obtain a more holistic view of a system by combining multiple ‘omics analyses. Our `mixOmics` R package proposes a whole range of multivariate methods that we developed and validated on many biological studies to gain more insight into ‘omics biological studies.

Our latest bookdown vignette: https://mixomicsteam.github.io/Bookdown/.

## Different types of methods

We have developed 17 novel multivariate methods (the package includes 19 methods in total). The names are full of acronyms, but are represented in this diagram. 
_PLS_ stands for _Projection to Latent Structures_ (also called Partial Least Squares, but not our preferred nomenclature), _CCA_ for _Canonical Correlation Analysis_. 

That's it! Ready! Set! Go!

Thank you for using `mixOmics`!
